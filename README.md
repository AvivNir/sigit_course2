## Course exercises
The "Next.py" course includes a series of Python exercises that cover various topics,  
The exercise's answers are provided in separate directories each directory with the unit's number  
with each file containing several answers in python files.  

In this project, you can find the Python files with the answers to the course exercises.   
The files are organized by unit number, and each file includes the exercise number and its solution.  

### The topics covered in the course include:
- [One-Liners](unit1) - **unit1** 
- [Object Oriented Programming](unit2) - **unit2** 
- [Exceptions](unit3) - **unit3**
- [Generators](unit4) - **unit4**
- [Iteration under the hood](unit5) - **unit5**
- [Modules](unit6) - **unit6**


## Final tasks
In this repository, you will find the solutions for the final tasks of each unit in the "next.py"      
online course. Each unit's final task focuses on a specific topic and requires developing a program
or solve a programming problem using the concepts learned in that unit. the solutions for each
unit's final task can be found as the last exercise python file in each unit's directory.      
- **unit1** - [exe_1.5.py](unit1/exe_1.5.py)
- **unit2** - [exe_2.5.py](unit2/exe_2.5.py)
- **unit3** - [exe_3.4.py](unit3/exe_3.4.py)
- **unit4** - [exe_4.4.py](unit4/exe_4.4.py)
- **unit5** - [exe_5.4.py](unit5/exe_5.4.py)
- **unit6** - [exe_6.4.py](unit6/exe_6.4.py)
